# Dwelling-Laundry-Catalog
A Database Management System for logging laundry in a multi-person dwelling

## Description
This is a catalog to log all the laundry in a multi-person house. It will contain information about who owns different pieces of clothing and who is allowed to wash it. Additionally, it will contain information on how laundry should be cleaned and where to clean it. <br>
Roommates will enter their laundry information. They can then mark their clothes as worn and tell the app that it's been washed. If they are going to do a load of laundry, they can also get information on their roommates' laundry, should they want to clean those. This information will be about which clothes are compatible with the washing methods they want to use (machine wash only, separating darks and colors, etc.). This should all provide for a more efficient home laundry system. Lastly, the catalog will track laundry history, keeping a table of when laundry was done, which clothing was washed, and when.
